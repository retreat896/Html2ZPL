# ZPL GUI Editor V2
=====================
## Current Status: ```Proof of Concept -> Development```

**DO NOT EXPECT THIS PROJECT TO WORK FULLY. IT IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND IS
LIKELY TO CONTAIN BUGS AND INCOMPLETE FEATURES.**
This project is meant to emulate a photo editor for the ZPL language once it is
complete. Currently, it has no ZPL functionality at all.
